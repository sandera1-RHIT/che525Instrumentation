In this project, we built a functional control panel with a few varying instrumentation.  The control panel included a power supply, a breaker junction, the Controller and IO card deck, and an ethernet switch. The power supply took in 120V AC power and changed it into 24V DC. The Controller and IO card deck housed the controllers and specific intrumentation cards. The instruments were connected to power through their respective IO card or through the breaker junction if needed. The different instrumentation that we installed were a Coriolis flow meter, RTD (temperature), and 2 pressure gauges.
